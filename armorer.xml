      <p>An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies armor to function almost like a second skin. The armor is enhanced to hone the artificer’s magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.</p>

      <p>Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your artificer magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of heavy armor you are wearing into power armor, provided you have smith’s tools in hand.</p>
      <p class="indent">You gain the following benefits while wearing the power armor:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the power armor lacks this requirement for you.</li>
        <li>You can use the power armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</li>
        <li>The power armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, and it replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The armor continues to be power armor until you doff it, you don another suit of armor, or you die.</p>

          <strong>Defensive Field.</strong> You gain a bonus action that you can use on each of your turns to gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor.
