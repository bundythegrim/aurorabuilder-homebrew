      <p>A chanter of the Abyss has the blood of an ancient and dark homeland coursing through their veins. Perhaps they were born with the blood of the elder gods or an extraordinary hero of the past. Perhaps you were touched by a powerful artifact or born in the presence of a greater being. Regardless of how you got your abilities you are innately proficient with magic and the blade.</p>

      <p>You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Primordial Spells table. Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.</p>
      <p>Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a conjuration or an evocation spell from the sorcerer, warlock or wizard spell list, but will no longer work with your Electron Sorcery feature.</p>

      <p>You can invoke a secret abyssal magic called the Abyssal Chant, provided that you aren’t wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can use a bonus action to start Abyssal Chant, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Abyssal Chant at any time (no action required).</p>
      <p class="indent">While your Abyssal Chant is active, you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1)</li>
        <li>Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
        <li>You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.</li>
        <li>You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).</li>

      <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
